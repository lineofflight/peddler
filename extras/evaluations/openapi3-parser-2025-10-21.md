# Evaluation: Using openapi3_parser for Peddler Generator

Date: 2025-10-21
Evaluator: Claude Code

## Executive Summary

This evaluation assesses the feasibility of replacing Peddler's current custom OpenAPI parsing (Swagger 2.0 + JSON.parse) with the `kevindew/openapi3_parser` gem. The switch would require converting Amazon's Swagger 2.0 specs to OpenAPI 3.0 using `swagger2openapi`.

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **PROCEED WITH CAUTION**

While technically feasible, the switch introduces significant complexity and trade-offs that may not justify the benefits for this use case.

## Current Approach

**Tech Stack:**
- Swagger 2.0 specs from Amazon
- `JSON.parse` for loading specs
- Custom parsers in `lib/generator/parsers/`
- Custom resolvers in `lib/generator/resolvers/`
- Manual `$ref` resolution via `TypeResolver`
- Manual `allOf` merging in `Type#merge_from_all_of`

**Lines of Custom Code:**
- `parsers/path.rb`: ~47 lines
- `resolvers/type_resolver.rb`: ~220 lines
- `builders/type.rb`: ~362 lines
- Total parsing logic: ~630 lines

## Proposed Approach

**Tech Stack:**
- Convert Swagger 2.0 → OpenAPI 3.0 (swagger2openapi)
- Parse with openapi3_parser gem
- Automatic `$ref` resolution
- Semi-automatic `allOf` handling (still needs iteration)

## Key Findings

### 1. Conversion Success Rate

Tested 10 Amazon specs:
- **Success:** 8/10 (80%)
- **Failed:** 2/10 (20%)
  - `customerFeedback_2024-06-01.json` - Malformed spec (fixable with `--patch` flag)
  - `easyShip_2022-03-23.json` - Parser error

**Finding:** Most specs convert successfully, but malformed specs require special handling.

### 2. $ref Resolution

**Current:**
```ruby
# Manual resolution in TypeResolver
def resolve_ref_type(ref, for_comment, for_rbs = false)
  ref_name = ref.split("/").last
  # ... 15 more lines of logic
end
```

**With openapi3_parser:**
```ruby
# Automatic resolution
schema.properties.each do |prop_name, prop_schema|
  # $refs are already resolved
  type = prop_schema.type  # Just works!
end
```

**Benefit:** Eliminates ~100 lines of complex $ref resolution logic.

### 3. allOf Handling

**Current:**
```ruby
# Type#merge_from_all_of manually merges properties
definition["allOf"].each do |schema|
  if schema["$ref"]
    ref_def = specification.dig("definitions", ref_name)
    # ... manual merging logic
  end
end
```

**With openapi3_parser:**
```ruby
# Still requires manual iteration, but $refs are resolved
schema.all_of.each do |item|
  # item.properties already resolved!
  all_props.concat(item.properties.keys)
end
```

**Benefit:** Simpler, but not eliminated. Still need to aggregate properties from `all_of` array.

### 4. Validation

**Current:** No built-in validation

**With openapi3_parser:**
```ruby
document = Openapi3Parser.load_file(spec_file)
if document.valid?
  # proceed
else
  puts document.errors  # Detailed validation errors
end
```

**Benefit:** Catches malformed specs early in development.

### 5. Performance Impact

Tested with 50 iterations of catalog-items spec:

| Metric | Current (JSON) | New (openapi3_parser) | Overhead |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|----------|
| Parsing | 66.84ms | 169.03ms | +153% |
| Conversion (one-time) | N/A | 187.99ms | N/A |

**Finding:** Significant parsing overhead, but conversion is one-time cost that could be done during `bundle exec rake generate` setup.

### 6. API Differences

**Accessing Paths:**

Current:
```ruby
model["paths"].each do |path, methods|
  methods.select { |k, _| %w[get post].include?(k) }.each do |method, operation|
    operation["operationId"]
  end
end
```

New:
```ruby
document.paths.each do |path, path_item|
  %w[get post].each do |method|
    operation = path_item.send(method)
    operation.operation_id if operation
  end
end
```

**Accessing Schemas:**

Current:
```ruby
spec["definitions"].each do |name, definition|
  definition["properties"]
end
```

New:
```ruby
document.components.schemas.each do |name, schema|
  schema.properties
end
```

**Finding:** Different API requires updating all generator code.

## Pros and Cons

### ✅ Pros

1. **Automatic $ref Resolution**
   - Eliminates ~100 lines of complex resolution logic
   - Reduces chances of resolution bugs
   - Cleaner, more maintainable code

2. **Built-in Validation**
   - Catches malformed specs during development
   - Better error messages than custom parser
   - Helps identify issues in Amazon's specs

3. **Type Safety**
   - Object-oriented API vs hash access
   - Better IDE autocomplete support
   - Harder to make typos (e.g., `schema.properties` vs `spec["properteis"]`)

4. **Industry Standard**
   - OpenAPI 3.0 is the current standard (Swagger 2.0 is deprecated)
   - More tooling and ecosystem support
   - Future-proof as more specs migrate to OAS3

5. **Simplified TypeResolver**
   - Current: 220 lines
   - Estimated after: ~100 lines (50% reduction)

### ❌ Cons

1. **Conversion Step Required**
   - All 100+ Amazon specs need conversion
   - Adds ~188ms per spec (one-time cost)
   - Need to handle conversion errors
   - Requires Node.js dependency (swagger2openapi)

2. **Performance Overhead**
   - 153% slower parsing vs JSON.parse
   - Matters during development when running generator repeatedly
   - Could be mitigated by caching converted specs

3. **allOf Not Fully Automatic**
   - Still need to iterate `schema.all_of` and aggregate properties
   - Similar complexity to current `merge_from_all_of`
   - Expected "auto-merge" doesn't happen

4. **Migration Effort**
   - Update all generator code to use new API
   - Rewrite tests to match new approach
   - Risk of introducing bugs during migration
   - Estimated: 2-3 days of work

5. **Additional Dependency**
   - Ruby: `openapi3_parser` gem
   - Node: `swagger2openapi` (for conversion)
   - More dependencies = more potential breakage

6. **Malformed Specs**
   - Some Amazon specs fail conversion
   - Need special handling (`--patch` flag)
   - Could break generator for certain APIs

7. **Loss of Direct Control**
   - Custom parser gives full control over behavior
   - openapi3_parser might have bugs or limitations
   - Harder to debug third-party code

## Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Conversion Pipeline

Need to decide when/where to convert specs:

**Option A: Convert During Generation**
```ruby
def generate
  Specs.sync  # Clone Amazon specs
  Specs.convert_to_oas3  # New step: convert all specs
  API.generate  # Use converted specs
end
```

Pros: Always fresh
Cons: Slow, requires Node.js at runtime

**Option B: Pre-convert and Commit**
```ruby
# One-time conversion, commit OAS3 specs to repo
selling-partner-api-models-oas3/
```

Pros: Fast, no Node.js dependency at runtime
Cons: Large files in repo, sync issues

**Option C: Lazy Conversion with Caching**
```ruby
# Convert on-demand, cache results
def load_spec(file)
  cache_file = convert_to_oas3_cached(file)
  Openapi3Parser.load_file(cache_file)
end
```

Pros: Fast after first run, no committed files
Cons: Complex cache invalidation

### Challenge 2: allOf Still Requires Custom Logic

Expected:
```ruby
schema.properties  # Auto-merged from allOf
```

Reality:
```ruby
# Still need custom aggregation
all_props = {}
schema.all_of.each do |item|
  all_props.merge!(item.properties) if item.properties
end
```

This was a major expected benefit, but it's not as automatic as hoped.

### Challenge 3: Handling Malformed Specs

Some Amazon specs are malformed:
```
customerFeedback_2024-06-01.json: collectionFormat is only applicable to array
```

Need error handling:
```ruby
begin
  system("swagger2openapi --patch --outfile #{out} #{input}")
rescue
  # Fallback? Skip? Warn?
end
```

## Code Complexity Comparison

**Conversion Logic:** ~50 lines (new)

**Total:** ~450 lines

**Net Reduction:** 180 lines (29%)

## Alternative: Improve Current Parser

Instead of switching, could improve current parser:

1. **Add Validation**
   ```ruby
   # Use JSON Schema validator on Swagger 2.0 specs
   gem 'json-schema'
   ```

2. **Refactor TypeResolver**
   - Extract $ref resolution to separate class
   - Add caching for resolved types
   - Better error messages

3. **Document Quirks**
   - Add comments explaining allOf handling
   - Document Amazon-specific workarounds

**Estimated Effort:** 1 day vs 2-3 days for migration

## Recommendations

### 🔴 DO NOT SWITCH if:

1. You value **stability** over modernization
2. You want to **minimize dependencies**
3. You need **maximum performance** during development
4. The current parser works reliably (no known bugs)
5. You have limited time for migration testing

### 🟢 DO SWITCH if:

1. You're experiencing **$ref resolution bugs**
2. You want **better validation** of Amazon's specs
3. You're willing to invest 2-3 days in migration
4. You value **industry standards** (OAS3 > Swagger 2)
5. You plan to add more generator features (ROI on cleaner code)

### 🟡 HYBRID APPROACH:

**Start with proof-of-concept for ONE API:**

1. Pick a complex API (e.g., product-pricing with allOf)
2. Convert and generate with openapi3_parser
3. Compare generated code line-by-line
4. If identical → continue with more APIs
5. If different → investigate and decide

**Benefits:**
- Low risk (can revert easily)
- Real-world validation
- Clear success criteria (generated code unchanged)

## Success Criteria

If you proceed, consider the switch successful when:

1. ✅ **Generated code is identical** (or changes are intentional improvements)
2. ✅ **All tests pass** without modification
3. ✅ **Generation time < 2x current** (acceptable overhead)
4. ✅ **All Amazon specs convert** (or failures are documented/handled)
5. ✅ **Code is more maintainable** (subjective but important)

## Next Steps

If moving forward:

1. **Create feature branch** (`feature/openapi3-parser`)
2. **Pick pilot API** (suggest: catalog-items or product-pricing)
3. **Implement conversion** (cache in tmp/ directory)
4. **Update generator** for pilot API only
5. **Run diff** on generated code
6. **Run tests** for pilot API
7. **Evaluate results** against success criteria
8. **Decide:** Continue to all APIs or revert

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Day 1: Setup conversion, update generator for pilot
- Day 2: Fix issues, compare output
- Day 3: Expand to more APIs if successful
- Day 4: Testing and documentation

## Conclusion

Using `openapi3_parser` is **technically feasible** but introduces **significant trade-offs**:

- **Pros:** Cleaner code, better validation, industry standard
- **Cons:** More dependencies, slower parsing, migration effort

The **29% code reduction** is modest compared to the **migration risk** and **performance impact**.

**Final Recommendation:**

Unless you're experiencing specific pain points with the current parser (like $ref bugs or allOf edge cases), the **cost of migration outweighs the benefits**. The current parser is "janky" but it **works reliably** for Amazon's specs.

However, if you do switch:
1. Use the **hybrid approach** (pilot one API first)
2. Implement **cached conversion** (don't convert on every run)
3. Set up **diff testing** (ensure generated code is identical)
4. Budget **3-4 days** for full migration

The evaluation proves it's **possible**, but **not necessarily advisable** given the marginal benefits vs migration cost.
