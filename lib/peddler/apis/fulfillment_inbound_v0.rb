    # The Selling Partner API for Fulfillment Inbound lets you create applications that create and update inbound
    # shipments of inventory to Amazon's fulfillment network.
    class FulfillmentInboundV0 < API
      # Returns one or more inbound shipment plans, which provide the information you need to create one or more inbound
      # shipments for a set of items that you specify. Multiple inbound shipment plans might be required so that items

      # customer. Alternatively, two inbound shipment plans might be created with the same Amazon fulfillment center
      # destination if the two shipment plans require different processing—for example, items that require labels must
      # be shipped separately from stickerless, commingled inventory.
