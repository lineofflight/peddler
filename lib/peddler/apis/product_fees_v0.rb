    # Selling Partner API for Product Fees
    #
    # The Selling Partner API for Product Fees lets you programmatically retrieve estimated fees for a product. You can
    # then account for those fees in your pricing.
    class ProductFeesV0 < API
      # Returns the estimated fees for the item indicated by the specified seller SKU in the marketplace specified in
      # the request body. **Note:** The parameters associated with this operation may contain special characters that
      # require URL encoding to call the API. To avoid errors with SKUs when encoding URLs, refer to [URL
      # Encoding](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/url-encoding). You can call `getMyFeesEstimateForSKU`
      # for an item on behalf of a selling partner before the selling partner sets the item's price. The selling partner
      # can then take any estimated fees into account. Each fees estimate request must include an original identifier.
      # This identifier is included in the fees estimate so that you can correlate a fees estimate with the original
      # request. **Note:** This identifier value is used to identify an estimate. Actual costs may vary. Search "fees"
      # in [Seller Central](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/) and consult the store-specific fee schedule for the most
      # up-to-date information. **Note:** When sellers use the `getMyFeesEstimateForSKU` operation with their
      # `SellerSKU`, they get accurate fees based on real item measurements, but only after they've sent their items to
      # Amazon.
