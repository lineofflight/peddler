    # With the FBA Inbound Eligibility API, you can build applications that let sellers get eligibility previews for
    # items before shipping them to Amazon's fulfillment centers. With this API you can find out if an item is eligible
    # for inbound shipment to Amazon's fulfillment centers in a specific marketplace. You can also find out if an item
    # is eligible for using the manufacturer barcode for FBA inventory tracking. Sellers can use this information to
    # inform their decisions about which items to ship Amazon's fulfillment centers.

      # This operation gets an eligibility preview for an item that you specify. You can specify the type of eligibility
      # preview that you want (INBOUND or COMMINGLING). For INBOUND previews, you can specify the marketplace in which
      # you want to determine the item's eligibility.
      #
      # @note This operation can make a static sandbox call.
      # @param marketplace_ids [Array<String>] The identifier for the marketplace in which you want to determine

      # @param program [String] The program that you want to check eligibility against.
      # @param rate_limit [Float] Requests per second
