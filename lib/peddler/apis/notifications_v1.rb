    # Selling Partner API for Notifications

    # The Selling Partner API for Notifications lets you subscribe to notifications that are relevant to a selling
    # partner's business. Using this API you can create a destination to receive notifications, subscribe to
    # notifications, delete notification subscriptions, and more. For more information, refer to the [Notifications Use
    # Case Guide](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/notifications-api-v1-use-case-guide).

      # subscription identifier.
