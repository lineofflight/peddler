    # Selling Partner API for Solicitations
    #
    # With the Solicitations API you can build applications that send non-critical solicitations to buyers. You can get
    # a list of solicitation types that are available for an order that you specify, then call an operation that sends a
    # solicitation to the buyer for that order. Buyers cannot respond to solicitations sent by this API, and these
    # solicitations do not appear in the Messaging section of Seller Central or in the recipient's Message Center. The
    # Solicitations API returns responses that are formed according to the <a
    # href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-08>JSON Hypertext Application Language</a> (HAL) standard.
    class SolicitationsV1 < API
      # Returns a list of solicitation types that are available for an order that you specify. A solicitation type is
      # represented by an actions object, which contains a path and query parameter(s). You can use the path and
      # parameter(s) to call an operation that sends a solicitation. Currently only the
      # productReviewAndSellerFeedbackSolicitation solicitation type is available.
      #
      # @note This operation can make a static sandbox call.
      # @param amazon_order_id [String] An Amazon order identifier. This specifies the order for which you want a list

      #   order was placed. Only one marketplace can be specified.
