# This file contains RuboCop configuration for auto-generated code that should
# not be modified by RuboCop auto-correction to maintain consistency with the
# code generation templates.

Layout/EmptyComment:
  # Generated API files contain empty comment lines that are part of the code
  # generation template structure. These should not be auto-corrected to avoid
  # constant diffs when regenerating from Amazon's OpenAPI specs.
  Exclude:
    - "lib/peddler/apis/*.rb"

Metrics/ParameterLists:
  # Some Amazon API operations have more than 5 parameters. Since these are
  # auto-generated from Amazon's OpenAPI specifications, we cannot control
  # the parameter count. This was added when Amazon's Seller Wallet API's
  # get_transfer_preview operation required 6 parameters.
  Exclude:
    - "lib/peddler/apis/*.rb"

Naming/AccessorMethodName:
  # Generated API files may have accessor methods that do not follow the
  # standard naming conventions. These should not be auto-corrected to avoid
  # inconsistencies with the code generation templates.
  Exclude:
    - "lib/peddler/apis/*.rb"
